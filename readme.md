# ğŸŒŸ Shiny-dex ğŸŒŸ

A dynamic web application that leverages the **PokeAPI** to fetch, display, and manage PokÃ©mon data in an appealing card format. Catch a glimpse of your favorite PokÃ©mon, filter the collection, and try your luck at finding a rare **Shiny** version!

## Features

* **Extensive Collection:** Fetches and displays PokÃ©mon from **ID 1 to 251** (Generation I and II) using the PokeAPI.
* **Detailed Card View:** Each PokÃ©mon is rendered in a stylish card showing its **ID, Name, Image, and Type(s)**.
* **Random Shiny Chance:** Each time the cards are loaded, there's a **1/77 chance** for any given PokÃ©mon to appear in its rare **Shiny** form.
* **Live Filtering:** Easily find any PokÃ©mon by typing its name into the search bar, with results updating instantly.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for a smooth experience across different devices.


### 1. Main Card View

The main interface displays the fetched PokÃ©mon cards. Notice the clean layout and the dedicated search bar at the top.

### 2. Live Filtering in Action

As you type into the search bar, the card collection updates dynamically, making it easy to zero in on specific PokÃ©mon. The user settings section (where the image originally pointed) is replaced by the actual feature of this app: **The Shiny Counter and Search input**.

## How it Works (Code Snippets)

### Fetching PokÃ©mon Data

The core data is asynchronously retrieved from the PokeAPI.

```javascript
// Fetches PokÃ©mon from base ID up to the limit
const getPokemons = async (base = 1, limit = 9) => {
    // ... loader management ...
    for (base; base <= limit; base++) {
        const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${base}`)
        const data = await response.json()
        packPokemon.push(data)
    }
    // ...
}
