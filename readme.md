## ğŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser to run the application, as all logic is handled client-side in JavaScript.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd pokemon-card-explorer
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`** in your favorite web browser.

## ğŸ“¸ Application Preview

Take a look at the application in action.

### 2. Live Filtering in Action

As you type into the search bar, the card collection updates dynamically, making it easy to zero in on specific PokÃ©mon. The user settings section (where the image originally pointed) is replaced by the actual feature of this app: **The Shiny Counter and Search input**.

## ğŸ’¡ How it Works (Code Snippets)

### Fetching PokÃ©mon Data

The core data is asynchronously retrieved from the PokeAPI.

```javascript
// Fetches PokÃ©mon from base ID up to the limit
const getPokemons = async (base = 1, limit = 9) => {
    // ... loader management ...
    for (base; base <= limit; base++) {
        const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${base}`)
        const data = await response.json()
        packPokemon.push(data)
    }
    // ...
}
